            As a Black coming-of-age story, set in 1968, highlights a pivotal
            moment in American history. Finally, America can learn what it was
            like to grow up as a Black boy only a few years after the Civil

            growing up and discovering their sense of morality, falling in love,
            or getting into trouble bothers some White folks to no end.
